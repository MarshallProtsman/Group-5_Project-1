# Ideas for Projects
Date Night App (movies, food, movie selection)
Dining and Events > select your focus for the evening and the other populates based on what you choose.
If we want to find something to do it feeds restaurant options.  If we want to eat and maybe catch something nearby, it can fetch that way.

Ideas for another day.....
Hiking Trails with Weather Conditions
Ingredients to create recipes and offer resturants if you don't like the recipe
Food and Drink Pairing App
Dog Friendly Locations/Services based on Location
Cocktails + Nutritional Information
Health/Demographic Data + Places to Volunteer in that location
